# Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 2: Review information about the vulnerable server

Vulnerability assessments typically include a description of the system being evaluated and the scope of the project.

Review the System Description and Scope of the Vulnerability assessment report.

The System Description highlights the relevant components, architecture, and dependencies of the system being assessed. All of these parts and connections make up the attack surface of the vulnerable information system.

The Scope specifies the focus and boundaries of the assessment. For example, you might specify that the scope of this assessment only relates to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data on the server—not the physical security of the server or its related IT systems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 3: Perform a risk assessment

Explore the Threat sources section of the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 resource. Using what you know about the vulnerable database server, notice the threat types and examples described.

In the Threat Source column of the Risk Assessment table of your template, identify three potential threats. Choose the threats using your best judgment and understanding of the earlier sections of the report.

NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 provides a comprehensive list of possible security incidents that could compromise a vulnerable information system—labeled Threat events. The list considers the average intent and capabilities of the threat source categories of the publication.

For example, a business competitor might have the technical capabilities needed to conduct a denial of service attack.

Explore the Threat events section in the resource. Then, identify three reasonable threat events that could be initiated, based on the threat sources you identified. Write the three threat events in the Threat Event column of the Risk Assessment table in your template.

You may recall from an earlier reading about calculating risks that potential threats and vulnerabilities are important factors to think about when evaluating the security of an asset.

Refer to the likelihood and severity sections of the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 resource and ask yourself the following questions about each threat that you identified earlier:

- How frequently could this happen?
- Would critical business functions be impacted?
- How might this affect the business and its customers?

Then, estimate a Likelihood score (1-3) and Severity score (1-3) for each threat and add your scores to the corresponding columns of the Risk Assessment table in your template. After, calculate an overall Risk score (1-9) for each threat using the formula (likelihood x severity = risk).

Note: The number of rows in a risk table can vary depending on the complexity and scope of the assessment. In general, it should provide stakeholders with a comprehensive overview of all significant risks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 4: Propose security recommendations

Another section that's commonly included in a vulnerability assessment is an explanation of your approach. This helps stakeholders understand your thought process of evaluating the risks you've identified—adding valuable context for stakeholders.

In the Approach section of your template, write 3-5 sentences (60-100 words) explaining why you selected the 3 specific threat sources/events you chose and why you think they're significant business risks.

Overall, a vulnerability assessment report should outline a strategy for addressing the risks of the target system. When possible, it should provide stakeholders with actionable steps that can be taken to remediate, or fix, vulnerabilities to avoid threats.

Note: Certain threats cannot be fixed. In those cases, it's equally important to consider a mitigation strategy—a plan to reduce the severity of a threat.

Think about security controls that could mitigate and/or remediate the risks you've identified:

- Principle of least privilege 
- Defense in depth
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA) framework

In the Remediation section of the template, write 3-5 sentences (60-100 words) summarizing specific security controls that can remediate or mitigate the risks to the information system.

Align your suggestions with the risks you've assessed. For example, suggesting public key infrastructure (PKI) to address exfiltration of sensitive information.
