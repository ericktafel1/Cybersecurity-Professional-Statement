# Scenario
Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

This scenario is based on a fictional company:

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. Their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.). The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture. The IT manager wants to use the audit findings as evidence to obtain approval to expand his department. 

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment. Then, perform an internal audit to complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist. 


# Solution

## Step 1 (Listing the audit goals, scope, and risk assessment):

Scope:

Botium Toys internal IT audit will assess the following:
- Current user permissions set in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, security information and event management (SIEM) tool.
- Current implemented controls in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
- Current procedures and protocols set for the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewall, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
- Ensure current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols in place align with necessary compliance requirements.
- Ensure current technology is accounted for. Both hardware and system access.

Goals:

The goals for Botium Toys’ internal IT audit are:
- To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)
- Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant
- Fortify system controls
- Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential management
- Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks
- Ensure they are meeting compliance requirements

Risk assessment

_Current assets_

Assets managed by the IT Department include:
- On-premises equipment for in-office business needs
- Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.
- Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory management
- Internet access
- Internal network
- Vendor access management
- Data center hosting services
- Data retention and storage
- Badge readers
- Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring

_Risk description_

Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have the proper controls in place and may not be compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards.

_Control best practices_

The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to managing assets. Additionally, they will need to determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

_Risk score_

On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to necessary compliance regulations and standards.

_Additional comments_

The likelihood of a lost asset or fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not adhering to required regulations and standards related to keeping customer data private.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 2 (Analyzing the audit goals, scope, and risk assessment):

What are the biggest risks to the organization?

_Data breach and theft._

Which controls are most essential to implement immediately versus in the future?

_SOC1 and SOC2_

Which compliance regulations does Botium Toys need to adhere to, to ensure the company keeps customer and vendor data safe, avoids fines, etc.?

_GDPR_

_PCI-DSS_

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 3 (Conducting the audit: Controls assessment)

Be sure to address the following elements in your completed activity:

Controls assessment
- All listed assets are accounted for in the controls selected
- Appropriate administrative, technical, and physical controls are selected (marked with an X)
- The priority level for each control selected is noted, based on the need for immediate or future implementation

Please refer to [Tafel Controls Assessment](https://github.com/ericktafel1/Cybersecurity_Portfolio/blob/main/Security_Audits/Tafel_Controls_Assessment.pdf).
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 4 (Conducting the audit: Compliance checklist)

Compliance checklist
- The compliance regulations and standards that Botium Toys needs to adhere to are selected (i.e., related to conducting business in the E.U., accepting online payments, user permission policies)

Please refer to [Tafel Compliance Checklist](https://github.com/ericktafel1/Cybersecurity_Portfolio/blob/main/Security_Audits/Tafel%20_Compliance_Checklist.pdf).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 5 (Communicate to Stakeholders)

Be sure to address the following elements in your completed activity:
- A high-level summary of the audit scope is provided (4-6 sentences or bullet points)
- A high-level summary of the audit goals is provided (4-6 sentences or bullet points)
- Critical findings are listed and explained
- Other findings are listed and explained
- The summary/recommendations clearly and concisely synthesize the most important information from the audit scope, goals, critical and other findings (5-10 sentences)

Please refer to [Tafel Stakeholder memorandum](https://github.com/ericktafel1/Cybersecurity_Portfolio/blob/main/Security_Audits/Tafel_Stakeholder_memorandum.pdf).
