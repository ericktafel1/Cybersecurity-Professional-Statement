# Entry 1 Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in delivering primary-care services experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning, at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported that they were unable to use their computers to access files like medical records. Business operations shut down because employees were unable to access the files and software needed to do their job.

Additionally, employees also reported that a ransom note was displayed on their computers. The ransom note stated that all the company's files were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers who are known to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. 

The attackers were able to gain access into the company's network by using targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees of the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that installed malware on the employee's computer once it was downloaded.

Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. The company was unable to access critical patient data, causing major disruptions in their business operations. The company was forced to shut down their computer systems and contact several organizations to report the incident and receive technical assistance.

# Entry 5 Scenario

Review the scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a level-one security operations center (SOC) analyst at a financial services company. Previously, you received a phishing alert about a suspicious file being downloaded on an employee's computer. After investigating the email attachment file's hash, the attachment has already been verified malicious. Now that you have this information, you must follow your organization's process to complete your investigation and resolve the alert.

Your organization's security policies and procedures describe how to respond to specific alerts, including what to do when you receive a phishing alert. 

In the playbook, there is a flowchart and written instructions to help you complete your investigation and resolve the alert. At the end of your investigation, you will update the alert ticket with your findings about the incident.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 2: Review the playbook and flowchart

Before you begin investigating the alert, take a moment to review the playbook and flowchart because you'll be using them throughout the investigation.

The Phishing Playbook instructions provide detailed, written instructions about each step represented in the flowchart.

The Phishing Flowchart provides a high-level overview and visual representation of the sequence of steps and substeps you'll take to respond to a phishing alert.

Note: The steps in theis playbook are not a definitive guide to responding to a phishing incident. Organizations have their own sets of policies, standards, and procedures that determine the expected response actions to incidents.
